# FOD

This is a school project I had in my app programming studies. It was a project in cooperation with the design students where they made a design mock-up for this app and I programmed it.

This app is created for FOD, a Norwegian association that works for finding a forever home for relocated cats and dogs in Norway. The concept of this app is to make it easier for people to adopt animals.
